Intro

Welcome to HubMinds app, your all-in-one solution for staying informed and organized throughout your day! With our Hub, you can effortlessly access key information such as your calendar events, the latest weather updates, and breaking news, all in one convenient place. Whether you're planning your schedule, preparing for the day ahead, or simply staying up-to-date with the world around you.

The Scope
------
We aimed to build an application with four main components: weather, calendar, news and bus routes. However, we were only able to complete the weather, news and calendar. 

- Weather - We wanted to create an accurate real time weather forecast that not only provides the temperature but other information like humidity and wind. Also, we planned for it to be able to give forecasts for later in the day not just the current time. This was achieved by using an API to obtain accurate weather forecasts for the requested location.

- Calendar - The calendar was intended to not only be a standard calendar that displays the current date but also to be interactive. Events can be added onto specific dates and times. Furthermore, descriptions for the events can be added aswell allowing the user to store their own specific events.

- News - An API was used to scrape the internet in order to obtain the latest news stories. The user can scroll throught the headlines and select any of them, this will in turn take the user to the full article.
